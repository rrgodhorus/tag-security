## Overview
External Secrets Operator (ESO) is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Google Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, IBM Cloud Secrets Manager, CyberArk Conjur and many more. The operator reads information from external APIs and automatically injects the values into a Kubernetes Secret.

### Background
The External Secrets Operator (ESO) is a tool designed for Kubernetes, a widely-used system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. ESO addresses a key challenge in this domain: secure and efficient management of sensitive configuration data, known as "secrets" (like passwords, API keys, etc.). Typically, managing these secrets within Kubernetes can be complex and risky if not handled properly. ESO simplifies this by integrating Kubernetes with external secret management services (such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault), which specialize in securely storing and managing these secrets. This integration not only enhances security but also streamlines the process of injecting these secrets into Kubernetes applications.

### Actors

#### 1. External Secret Management Systems
- Examples: AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault.
- Isolation: Network boundaries and authentication mechanisms separate these from the Kubernetes cluster.
- Security Note: A breach in these systems does not directly compromise the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 2. Kubernetes Cluster (including ESO)
- Role: ESO bridges Kubernetes and external secret systems.
- Isolation: Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) limits potential lateral movement in case of a compromise.

#### 3. Kubernetes Secrets
- Function: Store synchronized secrets within the cluster via ESO.
- Isolation: Kubernetes namespaces and access policies provide compartmentalization.
- Security Note: A compromise in one namespace doesnâ€™t necessarily expose secrets in another.

  ##### Isolation Mechanisms Overview
  - The isolation between these actors relies on network security, access control mechanisms, and the principle of least privilege.
  - This architecture ensures a limited scope of breach, even if one part is compromised.

### Actions
  For the External Secrets Operator (ESO), the steps it performs to synchronize secrets from external sources into Kubernetes can be outlined focusing on security checks, data handling, and interactions:

  #### 1. Client Request to External Secret Management System
  ESO, acting as a client, sends a request to an external secret management system (like AWS Secrets Manager). This request includes authentication and authorization checks to ensure that ESO is permitted to access the requested secrets.
  #### 2. Retrieval of Secrets
  Upon successful authentication and authorization, the external system sends the requested secrets to ESO. These secrets are transmitted over secure, encrypted channels to ensure their confidentiality and integrity.
  #### 3. Validation and Transformation
  ESO validates the format and integrity of the received secrets. If necessary, it transforms the data to a format compatible with Kubernetes Secrets.
  #### 4. Synchronization to Kubernetes Secrets
  ESO then creates or updates Kubernetes Secret objects with the retrieved data. This step involves interacting with the Kubernetes API server, which includes RBAC checks to ensure that ESO has the necessary permissions to perform these operations.
  #### 5. Use by Kubernetes Workloads
  Applications or workloads running in Kubernetes can then access these secrets. Access to these secrets within Kubernetes is controlled by namespace-specific policies and RBAC, ensuring that only authorized workloads can retrieve them.

  Overall, ESO's goal is to provide a secure, efficient, and reliable way of managing secrets in Kubernetes environments, ensuring that only authorized entities have access to sensitive data and that this data is handled securely at all times.

### Goals
    
  #### 1. Secure Secret Management
  ESO's primary goal is to securely manage secrets within Kubernetes by leveraging external secret management systems. It ensures that sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens are stored and managed in systems specifically designed for this purpose, offering robust security features.

  #### 2. Automated Synchronization
  ESO automates the synchronization of secrets from these external systems into Kubernetes, ensuring that applications always have access to the latest version of each secret.

  #### 3. Access Control
  By integrating with external secret managers, ESO inherits and enforces their access control mechanisms. It guarantees that only authorized parties can retrieve or modify the secrets, both in the external systems and when they are injected into Kubernetes.

  #### 4. Encryption and Integrity
  ESO ensures that the transmission of secrets from external systems to Kubernetes is secure, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data throughout the process.


### Non-goals

  #### 1. Secret Data Encryption
  While ESO manages encrypted secrets, it does not provide encryption services itself. The actual encryption and decryption are handled by the external secret management systems.

  #### 2. Intrusion Detection or Prevention
  ESO does not function as an intrusion detection or prevention system. It does not monitor or protect against unauthorized access within the Kubernetes cluster or the external secret systems.

  #### 3. Full Lifecycle Management of Secrets
  The primary role of ESO is to synchronize secrets from external systems to Kubernetes. It does not manage the full lifecycle (like creation, rotation, and deletion) of secrets within the external systems.

  #### 4. Direct Security Auditing or Compliance Assurance
  ESO does not perform security auditing or provide direct compliance assurance. It relies on the security and compliance features of the external secret management systems it integrates with.

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment is created by the External Secrets Operator (ESO) team to perform an internal analysis of the project's security. It is not intended to provide a security audit of ESO, or function as an independent assessment or attestation of ESO's security health.

This document serves to provide ESO users with an initial understanding of ESO's security, where to find existing security documentation, ESO plans for security, and a general overview of ESO security practices, both for the development of ESO as well as the security of ESO.

This document provides the CNCF TAG-Security with an initial understanding of ESO to assist in a joint-assessment, necessary for projects under incubation. Taken together, this document and the joint-assessment serve as a cornerstone for if and when ESO seeks graduation and is preparing for a security audit.

ESO has achieved a "passing" Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) best practices badge
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/5947/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/5947). The project is working on receiving a silver badge and is in the process of meeting the criteria for it.

### Development Pipeline

* All source code is publicly maintained in [GitHub](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets).
* Code changes are submitted via Pull Requests (PRs) and must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
* Commits to the `main` branch are merged only when a PR is approved and passes all checks.
* Once a pull request has been opened it will be assigned to a reviewer from external-secrets/maintainers.
* ESO uses the GitHub Bot [Paul the Alien](https://github.com/apps/paul-the-alien) (which is still in Alpha) to store the list of maintainers, to approve/merge PRs and to delete branches after PR merges.
* Raising a PR triggers a series of GitHub actions and workflows whose component checks are broken down below:
  * [Sonar Cloud Quality Gate](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=external-secrets_external-secrets) check initiated by the sonarcloud bot which checks for bugs, vulnerabilities, security hotspots, code smells, code coverage and duplication
  * Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) check to verify commits are signed correctly
  * Detect noop ([skip-duplicate-actions](https://github.com/fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions)) 
  * Linting check
  * Diff check
  * Unit tests
  * E2E tests

* ESO also maintains an official list of its [Adopters](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). 

## Security issue resolution
ESO's security policy can be found in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

### Responsible Disclosures Process
* ESO specifies that any security vulnerability found should be sent as a confidential email to contact@external-secrets.io and not be reported as an Issue.
### Vulnerability Management Plans
* ESO uses Github Security Alerts and Dependabot Dependency Updates to learn about critical software updates and security threats.
### Vulnerability Response Process
* No specific information on this is provided in the security file currently.
* Recommendation:
  * Dedicated email for reporting security bugs/vulnerabilities that is monitored 24x7.
  * Acknowledgement email to reporter within a reasonable time span once the process it started.
  * Information on maintainers who are charged with responding to security events (in case an immediate response is required).
  * Include a specific timeline/procedures to assign resources and fix a reported vulnerability.
### Incident Response
* Since this project does not directly handle any customer data, any users who experience an incident will report a vulnerability.


## Appendix

### Known Issues Over Time
* ESO tracks all bugs and issues publicly at external-secrets [Github Issues](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues).
* No major vulnerability has been documented or disclosed to the public.

### [CII Best Practices](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/best-practices-program/)
*  ESO has achieved a "passing" Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) best practices badge [![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/5947/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/5947). The project is working on receiving a silver badge and is in the process of meeting the criteria for it.

### Case Studies
* Use Case 1: Managing secrets for multiple environments

  A company has multiple environments for their applications, such as development, staging, and production. They use different credentials for each environment to access external resources, such as databases and cloud storage. ESO can be used to automatically synchronize these credentials to the appropriate Kubernetes secrets for each environment. This makes it easy to manage secrets and ensures that applications always have access to the correct credentials. 
* Use Case 2: Rotating secrets for security

  It is important to rotate secrets regularly to prevent unauthorized access. However, manually rotating secrets can be time-consuming and error-prone. ESO can be used to automate the rotation of secrets. ESO can be configured to fetch secrets from an external source, such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault, and then store them in Kubernetes secrets. ESO can also be configured to rotate secrets on a regular basis.
* Use Case 3: Accessing secrets from multiple sources

  A company may use multiple sources for their secrets, such as AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and a custom secrets store. ESO can be used to access secrets from all of these sources. ESO can be configured to use different secret providers for different types of secrets. For example, ESO could be configured to use AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials and HashiCorp Vault for API keys.

### Related Projects / Vendors
* Kubernetes External Secrets (deprecated): [kubernetes-external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets) is the original project kicked off by Godaddy while external-secrets is the newer one that replaced it. According to the team, KES does not have any dedicated or active maintainers at this time and is on limited life support. There were tech debts in the project that were causing issues and some of the dependencies they depended on are no longer maintained. To replace them would have required a sizeable effort. Also, KES was originally written in Javascript and the newer ESO is written in the more Kubernetes-friendly Golang. There is a [tool](https://github.com/external-secrets/kes-to-eso) available to migrate from KES to ESO.

* CSI Secret Store - Integrates secrets stores with Kubernetes via a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume. The Secrets Store CSI Driver `secrets-store.csi.k8s.io` allows Kubernetes to mount multiple secrets, keys, and certs stored in enterprise-grade external secrets stores into their pods as a volume. Once the Volume is attached, the data in it is mounted into the containerâ€™s file system. The differences between ESO and CSI Secret Store them are documented in this issue [comment](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/issues/478#issuecomment-964413129).
